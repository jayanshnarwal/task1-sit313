        In this project, I have made a
        <strong>Aurdino bluetooth rover with lights and horn</strong>. The
        Arduino Bluetooth rover with lights and horn is a
        <strong>captivating and interactive robotic marvel</strong>. Controlled
        effortlessly through a smartphone or computer via Bluetooth, this agile
        rover glides across surfaces with ease, responding promptly to users'
        commands. Its vibrant <strong>LED lights</strong> illuminate the path,
        adding a touch of enchantment to its maneuvers. Moreover, the inclusion
        of a lively <strong>horn</strong> provides audible amusement, making it
        an instant favorite among enthusiasts of all ages. This creative
        amalgamation of Arduino ingenuity, wireless technology, and playful
        accessories renders the rover an engaging and educational project that
        offers endless possibilities for exploration and fun. Whether it's
        navigating obstacle courses or delighting with its colorful display and
        cheerful horn, the Arduino Bluetooth rover ensures boundless
        entertainment and learning opportunities for aspiring inventors and tech
        enthusiasts alike.

        In this project, I have made a <strong>Smart Helmet</strong>. Delivery
        riders face safety challenges like accidents, impaired riding, speeding,
        and helmet misuse. Conventional helmets fall short in addressing these
        concerns. Faster accident response, prevention of impaired riding, and
        improved accountability with advanced helmet features are essential for
        enhancing rider safety, particularly for those working on delivery
        platforms. The Smart Helmet initiative aims to improve the safety and
        operational effectiveness of motorcycle delivery services. It
        incorporates sensors such as the MAX 30100 heart rate sensor, MQ3
        alcohol sensor, and Neo 8m GPS sensor to monitor the rider's health,
        track their whereabouts, and detect alcohol levels. This information
        allows for the early detection of health emergencies and effective
        delivery route planning.
